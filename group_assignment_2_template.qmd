# Research Goals

The goal of this report is to build a predictive classification model that can determine a kangaroo’s species from skull measurements. Correctly identifying species from skeletal features is useful in ecological monitoring, museum curation, and Paleontology field research where complete specimens are rare. In addition to developing and evaluating our predictive algorithm, we aim to highlight which skull characteristics most strongly distinguish species, supported by visualizations and model-based evidence.
